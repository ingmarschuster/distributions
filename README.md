# Distributions
Distributions related code for Python and numpy/scipy, providing
- Quasi-Monte Carlo primitives for drawing from several distributions (MVN, MVT, Categorical) using Low-Discrepancy point sets
- clean MVT implementation (lacking in scipy)
- clean Inverse Wishart and Normal Inverse Wishart implementation (lacking in scipy)
- clean implementation of some bijective transformations of random variables
